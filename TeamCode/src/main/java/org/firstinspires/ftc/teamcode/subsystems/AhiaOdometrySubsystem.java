    One way to accurately find these lengths is to pivot the robot (this will only work on symmetrical
    robots) in a perfect 360 circle. You can either do this by hand, or with the IMU.
    Output the raw tick counts of each encoder to telemetry and record them. This is the circumference
    of a circle in encoder ticks. Then divide the values by 2Ï€ and multiply by TICKS_TO_CM. This will give
    you the "radius" of the circle the encoder travelled in CM. The "radius" is the same as your L1/L2/L3.

    These tuning values are used to further calibrate the odometry pods. There will always be external
    factors such as size tolerances, friction, and assembly errors. These tuning values can found
    by rolling the robot by hand beside a set distance with a measuring tape and comparing the
    theoretical distance with the measured distance as a ratio.
    THEORETICAL DISTANCE / MEASURED DISTANCE
    These tuning values can be further improved on by running multiple tests and measurements and
    getting an average of those results. But bare in mind that this will never 100% correct all
    accuracy errors, only minimize them.
